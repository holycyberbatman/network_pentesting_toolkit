ZoneCheck  was initiated and  developed by engineers  working at AFNIC
in order to   check  the  correct   configuration  of  a  zone  before
delegation of  a domain name  under .fr.

Its development is still coordinated by people working at AFNIC.

* ZoneCheck 1.0

ZoneCheck was created in 1995 by Benoit Grange and has been maintained
by him  until 1997. The prototype was  a script using the dig command,
which evolved   into  a  Perl programme  based   on  the DNS  resolver
Resolv5.  Vincent Gillet maintained the programme  in  1998, this task
has been taken over by Erwan Mas  and Philippe Lubrano from 1998 on.

* ZoneCheck 2.0

It is a rewrite   from scratch done  in  Ruby at  the end of  2002  by
Stephane D'Alu, so as to create a modular and extensible version.

* ZoneCheck 3.0

This version was partially rewritten by Fabien Chabanne to leverage DNS
Client code in the Dnsruby library. This allowed the development of new
checks, including EDNS and DNSSEC support.
