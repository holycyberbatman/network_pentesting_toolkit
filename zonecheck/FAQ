   1. Where can I find documentation about Ruby?
      Try the offical Ruby website: [11]http://www.ruby-lang.org/
   2. I don't have IPv6 connectivity but ZoneCheck is still using IPv6
      addresses...
      ZoneCheck only looks for an enabled IPv6 stack to authorize the use of
      IPv6 addresses. It would be a good idea to disable the IPv6 stack on
      your computer if you don't have the connectivity or you can use the -4
      option to force IPv4 only connectivity.
   3. I want to use an interface other than the CLI.
      Use the environment variable ZC_INPUT set to your input mode, or use
      the command line option --INPUT=im. The input modes currently supported
      are CLI, CGI, and inetd
   4. The -d lvl option doesn't display earlier debugging messages
      Some debugging messages are sent before the debugging level is
      initialised by the command line, in this case use the environment
      variable ZC_DEBUG set to the desired level. But keep in mind that
      ZC_DEBUG will be overriden by the -d lvl option.
   5. I would like to easily test ZoneCheck without doing a full
      installation...
      You can define the environment variable ZC_INSTALL_PATH to the initial
      ZoneCheck directory.
   6. Why do I get rubbish or wrong results when doing the icmp test?
      ZoneCheck uses the command ping to perform this test, so you should set
      the constants ping4 and ping6 in the configuration file so that the
      ping is correctly invoked: stop after 5 echo requests, doesn't output
      messages, and return an exit code of 0 in case of success.

      If you are using ZoneCheck on the Windows platform, you better remove
      the test.
   7. Why did I get strange characters when using a locale other than
      US/English?
      The default encoding is UTF-8, either you can configure your terminal
      to use UTF-8, or you can specify the desired encoding after the locale
      by using a dot as separator (ex: LANG=fr.latin1); in the last case the
      ruby-iconv package should have been installed.
   8. ZoneCheck complains about the lack of TCP connectivity for a
      djbdns/tinydns name server...
      Unfortunately, by default, djbdns/tinydns does not listen on TCP. See
      [12]http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tcp.html to enable it.
   9. ZoneCheck crashes when reading configuration files or the message
      catalog
      REXML is used to parse the XML files, but it only checks for well
      formed XML and doesn't perform validation against the DTD, so when you
      edit the configuration file or the message catalog you should ensure
      that the files are valid, for that purpose you can use xmllint for
      example.
